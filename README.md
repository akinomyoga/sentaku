If you pass multi-word to sentaku by pipe at command line,
you can choose one of them in the selection window
then selected one will be returned.

# Installation

On Mac, you can install scripts by [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew):

    $ brew tap rcmdnk/rcmdnkpac
    $ brew install sentaku

If you have [brewall](https://github.com/rcmdnk/homebrew-brewall), add following lines to Brewfile:

    tap 'rcmdnk/rcmdnkpac'
    brew 'sentaku'

then, do:

    $ brewall install

Or if you write like:

    tapall 'rcmdnk/rcmdnkpac'

and do `brewall install`, you will have all useful scripts in
[rcmdnkpac](https://github.com/rcmdnk/homebrew-rcmdnkpac).

You can also use an install script on the web like:

    $ curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/rcmdnk/sentaku/install/install.sh| sh

This will install scripts to `/usr/bin`
and you may be asked root password.

If you want to install other directory, do like:

    $ curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/rcmdnk/sentaku/install/install.sh|  prefix=~/usr/local/ sh

Or, simply download scripts and set where you like.
